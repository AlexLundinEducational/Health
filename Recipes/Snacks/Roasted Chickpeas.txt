Roasted Chickpeas

Ingredients
2 tbsp. olive oil
2 (15 oz.) cans chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
1/2 tsp. salt (sea salt or kosher salt is best)
1/8 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp. chopped fresh rosemary
3 tbsp. fresh grated Parmesan cheese

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 400 F and line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Lightly pat the chickpeas (garbanzo beans) dry with a paper towel (or you can also use a salad spinner for this if you have one), and place in a large bowl.

Drizzle the chickpeas with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt or kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. 
Using a spatula, toss or stir very gently in order to coat the chickpeas with oil and salt as evenly as possible.

Arrange the chickpeas in a single layer on the foil-lined baking sheet and bake in the pre-heated oven for 15 minutes.

After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the oven, and shake it lightly to stir chickpeas, then bake for another 15 minutes.

Remove the pan from the oven again and sprinkle the chickpeas evenly with rosemary, then bake for an additional 8 to 10 more minutes, until the chickpeas are crunchy.

Finally, remove the chickpeas from the oven and while they're still hot, sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the chickpeas evenly, and gently toss to combine and coat.
