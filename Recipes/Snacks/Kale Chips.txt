Kale Chips

Ingredients
1 large bunch curly leaf kale
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon cold-pressed olive oil
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast

Instructions
Tear small pieces of kale off of the stems and lay them out on mesh dehydrator sheets (or baking trays if you are using an oven). Sprinkle raw kale with 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt and place in the dehydrator.

For the first hour, dehydrate at 145 F, then turn the trays around and lower the temperature to 115 F.

Check them in another hour and either remove or keep dehydrating to your desired crispiness.

Place dehydrated kale chips in a bowl and sprinkle with the oil, nutritional yeast and remaining sea salt to taste. Gently toss the kale (a sensitive operation but you'll get used to it) and serve your raw vegan kale chips immediately!

You can stop dehydrating your kale when they are at your desired crispiness.
