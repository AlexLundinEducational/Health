Kale and Basil Pesto

Ingredients

1 cup kale (if you have leftover steamed kale, you can also use that, but fresh is better)
1 cup basil leaves (fresh)
1-2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoon 
nutritional yeast (or vegan Parmesan cheese substitute)
2/3 cup nuts (pine nuts are traditional, but walnut and cashew nuts are nice for variety)
3-4 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons lemon juice (fresh is always best)
Sea salt and fresh black pepper to taste

Instructions

In a blender or food processor, combine the kale, basil, garlic, nutritional yeast, and nuts, pulsing just until coarsely chopped.
Slowly add olive oil, lemon juice and plenty of salt and pepper, blending just until desired consistency is reached.
For a thinner, saucier pesto, add more olive oil or other liquid.
