Ingredients
2 cups dry red lentils
2 cups water
1 clove of garlic
½ tsp salt
1 tsp dried oregano leaves

Instructions
Blend all ingredients (I used my Optimum 9400 high speed blender) until the lentils are thoroughly broken down.
Preheat a frying pan (greased with a little bit of olive oil if needed) over low-med heat.
Pour about ¾ cup of batter into the frying pan and spread with the back of a spoon (it will look like a huge pancake).
Fry for about 3 minutes or until top is dry/cooked through.
Flip and cook for a further 2 minutes.
Repeat with remaining batter to make 4-5 pizza crusts.
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.
Place the pizza crusts on baking trays and top with sauce & toppings of your choice, and bake for around 10 minutes.
Slice and serve.
